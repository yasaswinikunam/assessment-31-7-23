        <p class="bottom-left">Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country. People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 BCE. The modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine.</p>
        <p class="centered">For centuries Paris has been one of the world’s most important and attractive cities.</p>
